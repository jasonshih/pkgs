// HdfsScanner is the superclass for different hdfs file format parsers.  There is
// an instance of the scanner object created for each split, each driven by a different
// thread created by the scan node.  The scan node calls:
// 1. Prepare
// 2. ProcessSplit
// 3. Close
// ProcessSplit does not return until the split is complete (or an error) occurred.  
// The HdfsScanner works in tandem with the ScannerContext to interleave IO
// and parsing.
// For codegen, the implementation is split into two parts.  
// 1. During the Prepare() phase of the ScanNode, the scanner subclass's static 
//    Codegen() function will be called to perform codegen for that scanner type 
//    for the specific tuple desc. This codegen'd function is cached in the HdfsScanNode.
// 2. During the GetNext() phase (where we create one Scanner for each scan range),
//    the created scanner subclass can retrieve, from the scan node, the codegen'd
//    function to use.  
// This way, we only codegen once per scanner type, rather than once per scanner object.
