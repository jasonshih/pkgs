// This class encapsulates everything needed for hdfs scanners.  It provides two main
// abstractions:
//   - Abstraction of RowBatches and memory management.  Scanners should use the
//     memory/pools returned by this object and it guarantees that those buffers
//     are attached properly to the materialized row batches.  Scanners don't have
//     handle RowBatch is full conditions since that is handled by this object.
//     Resources (io buffers and mempools) get attached to the last row batch
//     that still needs them.  Row batches are consumed by the rest of the query 
//     in order and cleaned up in order.  
//     As soon as a buffer is done, it is attached to the current row batch.  This
//     gurantees that the buffers (and therefore the cleanup of them) *trails* the
//     rows they are for.
//     RowBatches are passed up when they are full, independent of how many io buffers
//     are attached to them.  In the case where a denser representation is preferred
//     (e.g. very selective predicates or very wide rows), the scanner context will
//     compact the tuples, copying the (sparse) memory from the io buffers into a 
//     compact pool and returning the io buffers.
//     TODO: implement the compaction
//   - Abstracts over getting buffers from the disk io mgr.  Buffers are pushed to
//     this object from another thread and queued in this object.  The scanners 
//     call a GetBytes() API which handles blocking if bytes are not yet ready
//     and copying bytes that are split across buffers.  Scanners don't have to worry
//     about either.  This is done via the ScannerContext::Stream interface.
//     A stream is a contiguous byte range that is read end to end.  For row based
//     files, there is just a single stream per context.  For columnar files, there
//     will be one stream per column.
//
// Each scanner context maps to a single hdfs split.  There are three threads that
// are interacting with the context.
//   1. Disk thread that reads buffers from the disk io mgr and enqueues them to
//      the context's streams.
//   2. Scanner thread that calls GetBytes (which can block), materializing tuples
//      from processing the bytes.  When a RowBatch is complete, this thread (via
//      this context object) enqueues the batches to the scan node.
//   3. The scan node/main thread which calls into the context to trigger cancellation
//      or other end of stream conditions.
