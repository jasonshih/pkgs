// The StateStore is a soft-state key-value store that maintains a set
// of Topics, which are maps from string keys to byte array values.
//
// Topics are subscribed to by subscribers, which are remote clients
// of the state-store which express an interest in some set of
// Topics. The state-store sends topic updates to subscribers via
// periodic heartbeat messages, which are also used to detect the
// liveness of a subscriber.
//
// Subscribers, in return, send topic updates to the state-store to
// merge with the current topic. These updates are then sent to all
// other subscribers in the next heartbeat.
//
// Topic entries usually have human-readable keys, and values which
// are some serialised representation of a data structure, e.g. a
// Thrift struct. The contents of a value's bye string is opaque to
// the state-store, which maintains no information about how to
// deserialise it. Subscribers must use convention to interpret each
// other's updates.
//
// A subscriber may have marked some updates that it made as
// 'transient', which implies that those entries should be deleted
// once the subscriber is no longer connected (this is judged by the
// state-store's failure-detector, which will mark a subscriber as
// failed when it has not responded to a number of successive
// heartbeats). Transience is tracked per-topic-per-subscriber, so two
// different subscribers may treat the same topic differently wrt to
// the transience of their updates.
