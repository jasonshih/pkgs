// updates from the state-store to a list of 'topics' that the
// subscriber is interested in; in response the subscriber sends a
// list of changes that it wishes to make to a topic.
//
// Clients of the subscriber register topics of interest, and a
// function to call once an update has been received. Each callback
// may optionally add one or more updates to a list of topic updates
// to be sent back to the state-store. See AddTopic for the
// requirements placed on these callbacks.
//
// Topics must be subscribed to before the subscriber is connected to
// the state-store: there is no way to add a new subscription after
// the subscriber has successfully registered.
//
// If the subscriber does not receive heartbeats from the state-store
// within a configurable period of time, the subscriber enters
// 'recovery mode', where it continually attempts to re-register with
// the state-store.
